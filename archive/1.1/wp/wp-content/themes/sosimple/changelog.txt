## Version 1.0.5
- Very minor typography changes within "style.css".
- Added responsive typography styles within "style.css" for smaller tables and mobile.
- Post "Twitter Reply" options have been removed and are now available as an optional (free) add-on. See GetSoSimple.com for download.

## Version 1.0.4
- Post & Page meta boxes are now powered by the "Advanced Custom Fields" plugin. You'll need to install and activate the ACF plugin.
- Updated all custom fields with the "sst" prefix in order to eliminate any possible conflicts.
- All "sst" functions within "functions.php" are now "pluggable" which means that you can now customize So Simple using a child theme.
- Simplified post meta eliminating the need for Translations.
- Updated post discussion functionality within "index.php" that auto-generates a Twitter discussion link for each post. Please note that you need to have your Twitter ID set within your author profile in order for this to work.
- Added "404.php" which will redirect to the home page on 404's.
- Got rid of the the "Infinite Scroll" function/script in exchange for just displaying all posts by default. There's nothing to load but text anyway, so we might as well simplify.
