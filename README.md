# Portfolio 2.0

This repository will include all versions of my portfolio, both past and present.

## Changelog

### 1.0

Fresh out of the premiere 8-week intensive User Experience Design course at General Assembly, I needed a portfolio to showcase all of my UX/UI Design experience, and fast. I turned to the tools I knew best at the time, HTML/CSS and WordPress.

Launched September 17, 2013, it runs on WordPress and features my first child theme, "Authentic," based on the [Mindful](http://themetrust.com/themes/mindful/) theme at [ThemeTrust](http://themetrust.com/).

#### 1.1

Typography update. Swap highly decorative typefaces Comfortaa (headings) and Amaranth (body) for more legible and balanced sans-serif font stack.
