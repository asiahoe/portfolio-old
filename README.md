# Portfolio (Old)

This repository is no longer maintained, but is archived here to track my experiments with WordPress and Jekyll.

## Changelog

### 3.0 (:sweat:)

I'm currently working on the next iteration of the site, starting from the ground up. I'd also like to refactor the setup of this repository, but it's going to take some brushing up of my knowledge of git to make it happen. It may even require a new repository altogether. Stay tuned!

### 2.0 (2015-2017)

After months of freelancing and agonizing over my portfolio, I finally launched it on Wednesday, May 6.

![Portfolio Version 2.0](https://github.com/asiahoe/portfolio-old/blob/blog/planning/Portfolio-V2.png?raw=true)

After brief exposure to Ruby in a collaborative assignment with Ruby students at Metis, I wanted to peek a little more into the world of Ruby, and decided to ditch WordPress for Jekyll.

It's funny how cyclical things are. Getting started with Jekyll took me back to my early days when I was teaching myself HTML and CSS and abusing iFrames.

I'm happy that static websites are making a comeback. There's a certain level of intimacy I feel with my code without the filters of themes and plugins that a more robust CMS like WordPress can provide.

Lessons learned: commit early and often. Sadly, I made some pretty awful mistakes with my Sass file several times early on in the process and lost a lot of work. Take it from me; a "perfect" commit history does not exist, and is actually more useful if you're able to track your changes, no matter how ugly.

If you want to leave feedback on this version, [Dribbble](http://drbl.in/oEBS) is a great place to do so!

### 1.0 (2013-2015)

Fresh out of the premiere 8-week intensive User Experience Design course at General Assembly, I needed a portfolio to showcase all of my UX/UI Design experience, and fast. I turned to the tools I knew best at the time; HTML, CSS and WordPress.

Launched September 17, 2013, it runs on WordPress and features my first child theme, "Authentic," based on the [Mindful](http://themetrust.com/themes/mindful/) theme at [ThemeTrust](http://themetrust.com/).

#### 1.1

Typography update. Swap highly decorative typefaces Comfortaa (headings) and Amaranth (body) for more legible and balanced sans-serif font stack.
