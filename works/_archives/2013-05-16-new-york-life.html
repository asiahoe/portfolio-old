      <h3>Selected Projects</h3>
      <p>As the company began to assess its aging internal applications, the demand for UX grew. My team shifted into this role and began gathering content audits, performing user interviews, live wireframing, designing mockups, and conducting user tests with iterative, interactive prototypes.</p>
      <h4>Service Portal</h4>
      <p>Service Portal is a multi-million dollar endeavor that spanned several years. It was conceived to help streamline and consolidate the dozens of services and web applications used by customer service representatives and agents to process new business and manage existing accounts.</p>
      <p>In collaboration with business analysts, agents, and customer service representatives, I performed contextual inquiries, in addition to producing live wireframes in an agile environment.</p>
      <h4>Electronic Application</h4>
      <p>Agents and customer service representatives process a great deal of paperwork in managing customers accounts. E-App was designed to transition the new business acquisition process to an electronic one, making retrieval of documents easier, faster, less error prone, and more secure.</p>
      <p>My role included user testing, contextual inquiries, live wireframing, and rapid prototyping. I also produced styleguides in Adobe InDesign, covering everything from typography, color, and interaction patterns to help govern the engineering process abroad.</p>
      <h4>Design Guidelines</h4>
      <p>As New York Life began its rebranding campaign, I designed and maintained internal design guidelines outlining best practices and design patterns to govern elements including typography, colors, and interaction patterns.</p>
