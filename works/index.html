  <h2>Works</h2>
  <p>Thank you for taking a look at my portfolio! As a hobbyist and working professional since 2006, I've developed a wide variety of skills that empower me to design products from ideation to inception to production. Whatever my title, I design for people, enriching their experiences with design that excites, unites, and ignites their curiosity. For more information about my skillset and experience, <a href="/about/">read about me</a> or <a href="assets/docs/AsiaHoe-ProductDesigner-Resume.pdf">view my resume</a>.</p>
