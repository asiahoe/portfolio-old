subtitle: Multi-Platform Chat App for Gamers

excerpt: Gaming is often perceived as a solitary activity, yet gamers are more social than ever. While there is a plethora of social media apps available, very few have tackled social connectivity across gaming networks very effectively, or in a game focused context.

      <h3>Defining the Problem</h3>
      <p>While Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram, Skype, and other social media websites and applications are popular among gamers as stand-in solutions for their communication needs, they each come with their own quirks and are not tailored to the unique interests and needs of gamers as users looking to connect with others on different game networks. GameChat bridges the gap between the gaming networks and social media, allowing cross-platform chatting in a gaming context, or online.</p>
