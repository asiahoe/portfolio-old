    <h2>Curiousity Is My Superpower!</h2>
    <p>At 14, I was introduced to the web and discovered my calling. When I saw my peers, other young writers and artists across the globe, designing beautiful websites to share their works online, I had to learn how they did it. What began as a simple gesture of curiosity, a right-click to view source, quickly became my passion.</p>
    <p>I sought every book and website on the subject, quickly developing a proficiency in (X)HTML and CSS at the peak of the web standards movement and the blog's rise to popularity. Before long, my penchant for learning quickly and self-direction led to job opportunities in web design and development, both on campus and at internships in the city.</p>
    <p>Now, as before, I learn best by doing. I continue to read books and articles and attend meetups regularly. Teaching has also been instrumental in my learning, so I also run a meetup about all things tech with friends, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/techunderthirty/">Tech Under Thirty</a>, mentor young men of color interested in pursuing careers in the tech industry at <a href="http://www.allstarcode.org/">All Star Code</a>, and teach women how to design and code games at <a href="http://codeliberation.org/">Code Liberation.</a></p>
    <p>Curiosity is infectious. If you'd like to learn more about me, please feel free to reach out on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/asiah">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/asiahoe">Twitter</a>. You can also <a href="/assets/docs/AsiaHoe-ProductDesigner-Resume.pdf">view my resume</a>.</p>
    <h2>About This Site</h2>
    <p>I designed my portfolio website as I would any other product, beginning with sketches, wireframes, and lots of research. I designed it mobile first, responsively using HTML5 and CSS3 with <a href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass</a> and a pinch of <a href="http://bourbon.io">Bourbon</a>. In the interest of learning Ruby, and the added benefits of speed, portability, and security, coded the site from scratch to run on a static blog-aware site generator, <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Goodbye WordPress, for now.</p>
