  <p>Digitas Health LifeBrands is the healthcare and pharmaceutical arm of Digitas, a global marketing and technology agency. I was hired as a Senior Interaction Design contractor, and was charged with designing a wide variety of UX documentation for a number of pharmaceutical clients under the Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb brands. I worked very closely with the Associate Director of UX and the Lead UX Designer.</p>

      <h3>Select Projects</h3>
      <p>While I am not permitted to share my contributions at Digitas Health here, I would be happy to discuss samples with you. Below I provide an overview of the methodologies used in the projects. Most of the work was created in Adobe InDesign.</p>
      <h4>Heuristic Analysis</h4>
      <p>After thoroughly reviewing a brand's website, I compiled a document with thorough feedback on improving the website based on best practices, heuristics guidelines, and insights into the brand and its target market.</p>
      <h4>Card Sorting</h4>
      <p>As part of the redesign process, I conducted a card sorting exercise to determine whether the architecture of the existing website was both accessible and user friendly. I performed this exercise with several stakeholders, including potential consumers, visual designers, and business analysts. While the cards were devised from the site's existing architecture, participants were also encouraged to create their own cards. Each participant sorted their cards in the most logical manner possible, grouping duplicative content in stacks. Once our exercise was complete, we compared our results as a group, allowing us to better assess the strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in the site's existing content.</p>
      <h4>Mental Models</h4>
      <p>Using the site's architecture and the results of card sorting as a guide, I then began to explore the intersections between user goals and brand goals. User's goals generally take the form of questions or needs, while the brand's goals are both educational and prescriptive means to address those questions or needs. Using these guidelines, I began to plot out how content might be used to strategically address both user and brand goals.</p>
      <h4>Site Maps</h4>
      <p>Working in tandem with visual designers and writers, I designed site maps to determine the architecture of the site, including a high level view of how each node of content interacts.</p>
      <h4>Wireframes</h4>
      <p>Using the sitemaps as a guide, I began crafting wireframes of the website. Due to numerous legal restrictions in the pharamceutical industry, I had to be mindful of several design constraints while designing the wireframes. For example, pharmaceutical brands are required to display disclaimers for their products up front. This takes up a substaintial amount of screen real estate, especially on mobile devices. This design constraint required our designs to be as succinct and straightforward as possible, in addition to attractive and usable.</p>
